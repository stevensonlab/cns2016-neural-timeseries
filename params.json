However, neural time series are complex and often high-dimensional, and there is a major bottleneck in statistical and computational methods for making sense of them. We aim to discuss statistical approaches for analyzing neural time series to increase our understanding of the neural code and computation. Scientific questions of interest include, but not limited to,\r\n1. How can we incorporate neuroscience knowledge on the structure of the circuit or dynamics into neural data analysis?\r\n2. How can we make efficient use of noisy, limited data? and\r\n3. What machine learning tools can be applied to nonlinear neural time series?\r\n\r\n# Confirmed Speakers\r\n* Shin Ishii, Kyoto University, Japan\r\n* Justin Dauwels, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore\r\n* Taro Toyoizumi, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Japan\r\n* Sukbin Lim, NYU Shanghai, China\r\n* Eftychios Pnevmatikakis, Simons Center for Data Analysis, USA\r\n* Memming Park, Stony Brook University, USA\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
