{"name":"Statistical Analysis of Neural Time Series","tagline":"CNS 2016 Workshop","body":"# Organizers\r\nIl Memming Park\r\nStony Brook University, memming.park@stonybrook.edu\r\nIan Stevenson\r\nUniversity of Connecticut, ian.stevenson@uconn.edu\r\n\r\n# Description\r\nNew technologies for recording from large groups of neurons provide an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the nervous system implements computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, neural time series are complex and often high-dimensional, and there is a major bottleneck in statistical and computational methods for making sense of them. We aim to discuss statistical approaches for analyzing neural time series to increase our understanding of the neural code and computation. Scientific questions of interest include, but not limited to, 1) How can we incorporate neuroscience knowledge on the structure of the circuit or dynamics into neural data analysis? 2) How can we make efficient use of noisy, limited data? and 3) What machine learning tools can be applied to nonlinear neural time series?\r\n\r\n# Confirmed Speakers:\r\nShin Ishii, Kyoto University, Japan\r\nJustin Dauwels, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore\r\nTaro Toyoizumi, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Japan\r\nSukbin Lim, NYU Shanghai, China\r\nEftychios Pnevmatikakis, Simons Center for Data Analysis, USA\r\nMemming Park, Stony Brook University, USA\r\n\r\n# Invited Speakers:\r\nShinsuke Koyama, Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Japan\r\nAndrzej Cichocki, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Japan\r\nYiwen Wang, ZheJiang University, China\r\nSam Behseta, California State University - Fullerton, USA\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
